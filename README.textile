h1. OpenTransact a simple secure standard for financial transactions

!http://www.opentransact.org/images/logo.png!

The goal is to develop a very simple low level standard for transferring an amount of an asset from one account to another.

Most payment systems and existing standards use the messaging paradigm for historical reasons. OpenTransact specifically rejects the message paradigm and prefers the restful resource approach as used on the web with URL's and HTTP at it's core.

We aim to create a new standard from scratch ignoring all legacy systems, while leaving it flexible enough to allow applications built on top of it to deal with legacy systems.

The standard is designed to follow standard RESTful practices and be concise and human readable.
