2.  Introduction

   The goal is to develop a very simple low level standard for
   transferring an amount of an asset from one account to another.

   Most payment systems and existing standards use the messaging
   paradigm for historical reasons.  OpenTransact specifically rejects
   the message paradigm and prefers the RESTful (REpresentational State
   Transfer) resource approach as used on the web with URL's and HTTP at
   it's core.

   We aim to create a new standard from scratch ignoring all legacy
   systems, while leaving it flexible enough to allow applications built
   on top of it to deal with legacy systems.

   The standard is designed to follow standard RESTful practices and be
   concise and human readable.

2.1.  Assets

   Within OpenTransact we use the accounting definition of the word
   "Asset" to mean anything fungible about which one could make an
   accounting book entry.

   For example:

   o  money

   o  shares

   o  bonds

   o  mobile phone minutes

   o  hours of work

   o  property

   o  domain names

   o  tons of sand

   o  general admission tickets to an event

   o  et cetera

2.1.1.  Asset Service

   An Asset Service is a service maintained by an organization to manage
   accounts of one asset.  For money and other financial assets the
   Asset Service would normally be run by a Financial Service Provider
   of some type.  Other types of assets are offered by non-financial
   services.  The regulatory definition of "financial" is of course out
   of the scope of this document.

2.1.2.  Transaction URL

   Each Asset Service has a unique transaction URL.  An informal
   convention is developing, but is out of the cope of this document.
   Guidance concerning the form of these URLs with regard to specific
   details like currency, card type, size, color MAY become available in
   a future Best Current Practices document.

   The service available at the transaction URL MUST follow basic REST
   practices:

   o  A transaction URL such as
      https://paymentsarewe.example.com/prwpoints MUST NOT contain query
      or fragment part.

   o  Loading the URL into a normal web browser should present a human
      readable description of the asset.

   o  A POST to the URL is used for creating a transaction transferring
      value.

   o  A GET to the URL from a normal web browser with specific
      parameters becomes a payment request that the user can authorize.

   o  A GET to the URL in a machine readable form such as json returns
      meta data about the asset and optionally a list of transactions
      that the current user is allowed to see.

   o  Each transaction has a unique URL formed by appending a unique
      transaction identifier to the transaction URL, such as https://
      paymentsarewe.example.com/prwpoints/
      aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d.

2.1.3.  Example of Asset Services

   Lets say it's an imaginary electronic currency asset provider
   eepay.example.net they only offer one asset type, their currency.  So
   they would only have one transaction url:




Braendgaard, et al.      Expires April 21, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                opentransact                  October 2011


   o  http://eepay.example.net/transactions

   If the asset provider offered multiple currencies it should have a
   url for each currency as they are really separate asset types:

   o  http://eepay.example.net/transactions/usd

   o  http://eepay.example.net/transactions/euro

   A bank offering OT as an alternative to ACH service could have a
   tranaction URL for each of the currencies in which it offers checking
   accounts.  The details of interbank settlements are out of the scope
   of this document.

   o  http://coolbank.example.com/current

   o  http://coolbank.example.com/savings

   o  http://coolbank.example.com/bonds/mortgage

   A mutual fund company would have a url for each of their funds.

   o  http://fidelify.example.com/funds/sp500

   o  http://fidelify.example.com/funds/emergingmarkets

   With relaxation of current regulations on brokerage transactions all
   going through markets, a broker (rather, a stock market) could
   implement an OpenTransact API and have a different URL for each
   symbol.

   o  http://nyex.example.com/trade/AAPL

   o  http://nyex.example.com/trade/EBAY

   This would ease the barrier to registered securities being used
   directly as money.

   If we let the URL do the describing, there are many different
   possibilities.  This allows support for all manners of asset types.

   All the above examples are fungible assets.  In general it is best
   practice that one item of value for one asset is fungible for one
   another.

   For unique items such as domain names, property titles and diamonds
   that are unique and infungible, we can still create asset urls for
   each item, but only accept transfer amounts of 1.



Braendgaard, et al.      Expires April 21, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                opentransact                  October 2011


   All the above examples are fungible assets.

   For unique items such as domain names, property titles and diamonds
   that are unique and infungible, we may define a separate currency for
   the item representing partial ownership.  The legal framework for
   defining the resulting partnerships and their governance is out of
   scope of this document.

2.2.  Roles

   OpenTransact defines 4 roles:

   o  Asset provider

      *  The entity providing or issuing the asset

   o  Transferer

      *  The entity transfering an amount of the asset

   o  Transferee

      *  The entity receiving an amount of the asset

   o  3rd party application

      *  An application performing a transfer on behalf of the
         Transferer

2.3.  Transfer

   We will use the term "Transfer" as it is more widely applicable than
   "Payment".

   A Transfer is legally a transfer in ownership of some amount of the
   Asset from the Transferer to the Transferee.

   Eg.  A Payment of $12 from Bob to Alice is a Transfer of $12 with Bob
   being the Transferer and Alice the Transferee.

2.4.  Transfer Request

   A Transfer request is when the Transferee requests a transfer of a
   given amount of an asset from the Transferer.

   Eg.  Alice sends an invoice to Bob for $12.  This is a Transfer
   Request from Alice to Bob where Alice is the Transferee and Bob the
   Transferer.

Internet-Draft                opentransact                  October 2011


   A Transfer Request is simply a specially formatted payment link that
   takes Bob to Asset Service if followed.  The Asset Service shall
   present the Transfer Request to Bob who can authorize or decline it.

2.5.  Transfer Authorization

   A Transfer Authorization is when the Transferee or a third party
   application requests an authorization to transfer of a given amount
   of an asset from the Transferer.

   Eg.  Bob wants to hire someone on an online job board to edit a
   document for $33.  The Job Board creates a Transfer Authorization
   link.  Bob follows this link to the Asset Service and authorizes the
   Job Board to transfer $33 from his account to some one else within a
   time period.

   A Transfer Request is simply a specially formatted payment link that
   takes Bob to Asset Service if followed.  The Asset Service shall
   present the Transfer Request to Bob who can authorize or decline it.
   If Bob authorizes it the Asset Service issues an authorization code
   to the Job Board that they can use to exchange for an OAuth token.

2.6.  Exchange Transaction

   A Transfer is often but not always part of an exchange of value
   between 2 types of assets.  Eg.:

   o  10 consulting hours exchanged for 1100EUR

   o  10 USD exchanged for 8 EURO

   o  0.99 USD exchanged for an mp3 song

   There are as many different exchange mechanisms for creating
   exchanges as there are exchange types.

   o  Invoicing system

   o  App Store

   o  Web shop

   o  Auction site

   o  Stock Exchange

   It is outside the scope for OpenTransact to define every single type
   of exchange that is possible.  OpenTransact provides a fundamental

Internet-Draft                opentransact                  October 2011


   building block in building such systems.  It integrates well with
   exchange systems that don't yet understand OpenTransact.

2.6.1.  Exchanged item URI

   In an Exchange Transaction we can include a url to the exchanged
   item.  This URI could either be a link to the exchanged item itself
   or the unique URI identifying the transaction itself.

2.6.2.  Authorization

   A useful building block for creating Exchange services is the
   Transfer Authorization flow.

2.7.  Vocabulary

   OpenTransact includes a standard list parameter names used in the GET
   and POST requests.

   o  _asset_ - Transaction URL

   o  _from_ - Transferer account identifier

   o  _to_ - Transferee account identifier

   o  _amount_ - Amount of asset

   o  _note_ - Textual description of transfer

   o  _for_ - Identifier of exchanged item.  This SHOULD be a URI

   o  _redirect_uri_ - URI to redirect User Agent to

   o  _callback_uri_ - URI for performing callback after request

   o  _client_id_ - Identifier of 3rd party application

   o  _expires_in_ - Request that a token expires in given seconds

   They are designed to be small and semantically correct. eg

      A transfer of 10 USD from Bob to Alice for consulting.

   Would become the following:

   o  amount=10

Internet-Draft                opentransact                  October 2011


   o  asset=http://pay.me/usd

   o  from=bob@test.example..com

   o  to=alice@test.example..com

   o  note=Consulting on XYZ project

   o  for=http://myinvoice.test/invoices/123123

2.8.  Authentication

   OpenTransact does not define any new authentication mechanisms, but
   relies on the Asset Provider's existing mechanisms for authenticating
   the Transferer and OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] for authenticating 3rd party
   applications on behalf of the Transferer.

2.9.  Parameter encoding

   Since OpenTransact is designed to be simple to implement, the basic
   parameter encoding is URL form encoding.

   Data responses should be in JSON format.

   OpenTransact includes a standard for name strings and value ranges
   for use with the JSON objects returned from a request made to a
   compliant OT transaction URL.

2.10.  Extensions

   OpenTransact is designed to be extensible, either through proprietary
   extensions, conventions or futher standards.

   For example it may be useful to follow the lat/lon convention
   allowing geotagging of data.

2.11.  Notational Conventions

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234].

   Certain security-related terms are to be understood in the sense
   defined in [RFC4949].  These terms include, but are not limited to,
   'attack', 'authentication', 'authorization', 'certificate',

   'confidentiality', 'credential', 'encryption', 'identity', 'sign',
   'signature', 'trust', 'validate', and 'verify'.

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.

3.  Transfer Request

   A Transfer Request consists of a GET to the Asset URL.

GET /usd?to=bill@example.com&amount=100.00&note=Milk&redirect_uri=http://site.example.com/callback HTTP/1.1
Host: pay.me

                                 Figure 1

   We use the following parameters from our common vocabulary.  All
   fields are optional:

   o  _to_ Account identifier of Transferee.  If left out it defaults to
      the 3rd party applications own account on Asset Service or a
      predefined account as specified when authorizing the access token.

   o  _amount_ Amount as a number with decimal points.  Symbols are
      allowed but SHOULD be ignored.  If left out it defaults to the
      Asset's minimum transfer, 1 or an amount predefined when
      authorizing the access token.

   o  _note_ Textual description, which can include hash tags.  Asset
      Service may truncate this.  No default.

   o  _from_ Account identifier of Transferer.  This should normally be
      left out as it is implied by the authorizer of the Access Token.
      The Asset Service MUST verify that the Access Token is authorized
      to transfer from this account.  This could be useful for Asset
      providers charging their customers accounts.

   o  _for_ URI identifying the exchanged item.

   o  _redirect_uri_ URI for redirecting client to afterwards

   o  _callback_uri_ URI for performing a web callback

   When a user follows this link, the Asset Service should present the
   user with a form authorizing the payment.

   Note: Client can include OpenID Connect parameters.

3.1.  Response

   The user is redirected back to the clients redirect uri with the
   following url encoded parameters:

   o  _txn_url_ A url identifying the transaction.

   Asset provider can include an access_token in the query string of
   txn_url.

3.2.  Errors

   Error types use OAuth 2.0's error codes.  [OAuth.2.0]

4.  Transfer Authorization

   A Transfer Authorization consists of a GET to the Asset URL with a
   client_id.

GET /usd?to=bill@example.com&amount=100.00&note=Milk&redirect_uri=http://site.example.com/callback&client_id=1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: pay.me

                                 Figure 2

   A Transfer Authorization is really a OAuth2 Authorization [OAuth.2.0]
   with a few extra payment related parameters.

   We use the following parameters from our common vocabulary.  All
   fields are optional:

   o  _to_ Account identifier of Transferee.  If left out it defaults to
      the 3rd party applications own account on Asset Service or a
      predefined account as specified when authorizing the access token.

   o  _amount_ Amount as a number with decimal points.  Symbols are
      allowed but SHOULD be ignored.  If left out it defaults to the
      Asset's minimum transfer, 1 or an amount predefined when
      authorizing the access token.

   o  _note_ Textual description, which can include hash tags.  Asset
      Service may truncate this.  No default.

   o  _from_ Account identifier of Transferer.  This should normally be
      left out as it is implied by the authorizer of the Access Token.
      The Asset Service MUST verify that the Access Token is authorized
      to transfer from this account.  This could be useful for Asset
      providers charging their customers accounts.

   o  _for_ URI identifying the exchanged item.

   OAuth2 related parameters.  See [OAuth.2.0] section 5 for full
   details

   o  _client_id_ OAuth2 client id

   o  _redirect_uri_ URI for redirecting client to afterwards

   o  _callback_uri_ URI for performing a web callback

   o  _response_type_ token or code REQUIRED

   o  _expires_in_ Request the amount of time in seconds this token
      should be valid

   When a user follows this link, the Asset Service should present the
   user with a form authorizing the payment.

   Note: Client can include OpenID Connect parameters.

4.1.  Response

   Follows OAuth 2 response depending on response_type requested.
   [OAuth.2.0]

4.2.  Errors

   Error types use OAuth 2.0's error codes.  [OAuth.2.0]

5.  Transfer

   A transfer consists of a HTTP POST to the asset url by a 3rd party
   application on behalf of the Transferer.

   The Application should have an OAuth 2.0 access token issued as
   defined in the OAuth 2.0 draft section 5.

   POST /usd HTTP/1.1
   Host: pay.me
   Authorization: Bearer vF9dft4qmT

   to=bill@example.com&amount=100.00&note=Milk

                                 Figure 3

   We use the following parameters from our common vocabulary in 1.6.
   All fields are optional:

   o  _to_ Account identifier of Transferee.  If left out it defaults to
      the 3rd party applications own account on Asset Service or a
      predefined account as specified when authorizing the access token.

   o  _amount_ Amount as a number with decimal points.  Symbols are
      allowed but SHOULD be ignored.  If left out it defaults to the
      Asset's minimum transfer, 1 or an amount predefined when
      authorizing the access token.

   o  _note_ Textual description, which can include hash tags.  Asset
      Service may truncate this.  No default.

   o  _from_ Account identifier of Transferer.  This should normally be
      left out as it is implied by the authorizer of the Access Token.
      The Asset Service MUST verify that the Access Token is authorized
      to transfer from this account.  This could be useful for Asset
      providers charging their customers accounts.

   o  _for_ URI identifying the exchanged item.

5.1.  Response

   http 201 with Receipt json.

6.  Receipt

   The receipt is returned when creating a transaction as well as when
   accessing a transaction url.  It can also be used for creating a
   transaction list by the asset provider.

   The receipt is a JSON object consisting of the following fields:

   o  _txn_url_

   o  _to_

   o  _from_

   o  _amount_

   o  _note_

   o  _for_

   o  _asset_url_

   o  _timestamp_

7.  Asset Meta data

   A client can find out information about an asset by accessing the
   asset url directly with a http Accept header of application/json:

   GET /usd HTTP/1.1
   Host: pay.me
   Accept: application/json

                                 Figure 4

   This returns a json hash of meta information about the asset.

   The minimum required data would be:

   o  name - Short name of asset

   Further opentransact specific parameters could be:

   o  default_amount - The default amount transfered if an amount is not
      specified in a transfer

   o  provider_url - The provider of the asset's home page

   o  description - Short description

   o  logo_url - Image url for Assets logo

   o  unit - ISO currency unit of asset if monetary or other such as
      (minute, gram, point etc)

   Asset services can provide further information more specific to their
   particular asset type.

   If an OAuth Access Token is provided the Asset Service should provide
   information related to the capabilities of the token.

   o  balance - balance of account

   o  available_balance - available balance of account

   For tokens obtained through a Transfer Authentication this should
   reflect the remaining balance of the authorized amount.

   If tokens scope allows access to accounts transaction history, the
   transaction history should be included here:
